# OpenShift UPI Install Automation


 Note: This is meant only for reference purposes. While I try to maintain an updated list of vars for this repo, I don't use the vars in this repo to build my clusters.
 
 This repo is updated for OCP 4.10+. For earlier releases please see other branches.


This repo hosts playbooks for OpenShift UPI install automation for O^3  (OpenShift On OpenShift) and KVM/Libvirt. See guides for each platform for information on how to run their respective playbooks

## [O^3 - OpenShift On OpenShift](./O^3)
## [Libvirt/KVM](./libvirt)

This is a work in progress and there is lots of room for improvement. I will be updating this repo pretty often.
