# OpenShift UPI Install Automation

 Note: This repo is updated for OCP 4.8. For earlier releases please see other branches.

This repo hosts playbooks for OpenShift UPI install automation for O^3  (OpenShift On OpenShift) and KVM/Libvirt. See guides for each platform for information on how to run their respective playbooks

## [O^3 - OpenShift On OpenShift](./O^3)
## [Libvirt/KVM](./libvirt)

This is a work in progress and there is lots of room for improvement. I will be updating this repo pretty often.
